# vending-machine
A Java project simulating a vending machine using Spring DI.
This was completed as part of a training course and was my first foray into MVC.
It allows a user to enter money and choose a product, then returns change.
There are two custom exceptions, one for insufficient funds and the other for when the item's inventory is empty.
